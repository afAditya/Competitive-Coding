/*
Problem Statement

There are N

people living on a number line.

The i
-th person lives at coordinate Xi

.

You are going to hold a meeting that all N

people have to attend.

The meeting can be held at any integer coordinate. If you choose to hold the meeting at coordinate P
, the i-th person will spend (Xiâˆ’P)2

points of stamina to attend the meeting.

Find the minimum total points of stamina the N
people have to spend.
